description: Rupert Ralestone is officially the Marquess of Lorne - but with no family
  money or prestige, the title is worthless. He and his younger brother and sister
  return to the old family homestead - Pirate's Haven. Their only hope is to find
  the sword that was the family's talisman for generations, the Ralestone Luck, and
  restore it to its proper place. If they succeed, the family fortunes will follow.
